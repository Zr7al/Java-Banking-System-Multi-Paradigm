# Java Banking System (Multi-Paradigm Implementation)

This project demonstrates implementation of the same banking system using three programming paradigms:

- Procedural Programming
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Event-Driven Programming (Java Swing GUI)

The system supports deposits withdrawals transfers transaction history sorting and account management.

## Implementations

### Procedural
Single file implementation using static methods and global structures.

### Object-Oriented
Inheritance-based design using:
- BankAccount
- SavingsAccount
- CheckingAccount

Encapsulation, polymorphism, and constructors are used.

### Event-Driven GUI
Java Swing ATM interface using buttons, listeners, and event handling.

## Algorithm
Selection Sort algorithm used to sort transaction histories.

## Technologies
Java  
Java Swing
